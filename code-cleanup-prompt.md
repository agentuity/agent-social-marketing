# Code Cleanup and Simplification Prompt

I want to work on code cleanup, simplification, and readability for the file I'll attach or reference. What we've done to date works and is great, but it's getting a bit too verbose and a little over the top on defensive coding.

Please review and give me a plan. Dont write any code yet.

This is an example app that others will use for reference, so it shouldn't appear super hard or difficult to understand.

Please review the file and suggest ways to improve it with the following goals in mind:

## Improvement Goals

1. **Simplify validation**:
   - Create shared validation helpers to reduce duplication
   - Rely more on TypeScript's type checking where appropriate
   - Consolidate validation logic to the entry points of functions
   - Dont be obtusely defensive with 900 different checks on null or undefined

2. **Streamline error handling**:
   - Reduce the number of try/catch blocks
   - Simplify error messages
   - Consider using a more concise error handling pattern

3. **Reduce logging verbosity**:
   - Keep only essential logs that provide meaningful information
   - Simplify log messages
   - Use consistent logging levels

4. **Simplify the data flow**:
   - Make the code more linear with fewer nested conditionals
   - Use early returns to avoid deep nesting
   - Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing where appropriate

5. **Improve type handling**:
   - Rely on TypeScript's type system rather than runtime checks
   - Use type guards more effectively
   - Consider using utility types for better type safety

6. **Refactor repetitive patterns**:
   - Extract common code patterns into helper functions
   - Use functional programming concepts where they improve readability

Please review and give me a plan first. Don't write any code yet until I approve the approach.
